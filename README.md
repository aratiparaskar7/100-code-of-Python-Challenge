# 100-code-of-Python-Challenge

This repository tracks my progress through the 100 Days of Python coding challenge. I'll be posting the code I write each day, along with brief notes on what I learned.

Goal: To consistently practice Python, build my skills, and develop a portfolio of projects.

Starting Date: April 27, 2025

Let's Code!
I'm excited to embark on this journey and look forward to sharing my progress. Wish me luck!
